Don't let the MTA keep your change. Roundtrip shows you amounts to add to your MTA Metro card so that you break even.

<br><br>

There are a couple things that make it difficult to determine on the fly:
<br>- The MTA adds an 11% bonus to any amount you add to your card at $5.50 or more
<br>- The MTA only allows you to add amounts in increments of 5 cents

<br><br>
When you type in your card value, Rountrip takes into account these factors and shows you suggested amounts to add. Roundtrip also helps you find the best amount to add based on how many rides you want on your card.
